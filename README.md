# Discord music bot.js

 My first Discord bot, made with JavaScript, using the Discord API. 

 It's objective is to play requested songs in a discord voice channel, making a playlist whenever someone adds a new song to the queue. It has some slash commands to comunicate with the bot, including play, pause, skip, shuffle, skipto, info etc.
